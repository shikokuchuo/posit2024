# {mirai} and {crew}: next-generation async to supercharge {promises}, Plumber, Shiny, and {targets}

{mirai} is a minimalist, futuristic and reliable way to parallelise computations â€“ either on the local machine, or across the network. It combines the latest scheduling technologies with fast, secure connection types. With built-in integration to {promises}, {mirai} provides a simple and efficient asynchronous back-end for Shiny and Plumber apps.

The {crew} package extends {mirai} to batch computing environments for massively parallel statistical pipelines, e.g. Bayesian modeling, simulations, and machine learning. It consolidates tasks in a central {R6} controller, auto-scales workers, and helps users create plug-ins for platforms like SLURM and AWS Batch. It is the new workhorse powering high performance computing in {targets}.
